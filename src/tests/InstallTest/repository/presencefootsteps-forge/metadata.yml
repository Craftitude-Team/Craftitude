Name: Presence Footsteps for Forge
Description: >-
  Presence Footsteps adds new sound effects when Minecraft didn't play any sound at all, such as jumping, landing, walking on the edge of a block, foot shuffling when coming to a stop.

  It also plays sounds differently whenever you're running, and allows each block to be played in a different way: Metal fences does not sound like iron blocks; Walking over rails both plays a faint metallic sound and the surface below it; Walking on a piston pointing upwards sounds like wood.

  This package is compatible with Minecraft Forge instead of ModLoader.
